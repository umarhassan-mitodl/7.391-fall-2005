Introduction - Understanding by Design and the BCF
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
We will begin by introducing ourselves and talking about what each of us hopes to get out of the class, our backgrounds and sources of interest in the subject of the seminar. We will introduce the concepts of integrated curriculum and concept-centered learning. We will also discuss how these principles can be applied to the courses where we have only limited influence. We will also introduce the [BCF, the biology concept framework](http://web.mit.edu/bioedgroup/HBCF/CBE-Summer2004.htm), and we will talk briefly about how such an instrument can be beneficial in teaching and learning.

Meaningful Assessment
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Guest Speaker - Howard Everson, Co-chair AP Biology/NSF Advisory Committee.  
  
Ideally, assessment is part of the curriculum design, and emphasizes concepts identified as key during the design process. This ideal setup is almost never possible in the context of a large course where problem sets and exams are written and edited throughout the semester. We will hear about both the idea and real-world situations, and about how to bridge the gap.

Confronting Student Misconceptions  
  
Key Concepts in Biochemistry
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Whether it is our every day experience with falling objects, or our intuitive knowledge of heredity ("in his blood"), we all enter classroom with pre-conceived notions of the concepts at the core of the subject. Some of these pre-conceived notions are in fact misconceptions. Students who learn "over" the misconceptions tend to revert to their original, wrong, ideas after the course is over. It is increasingly becoming an accepted notion that effective teaching identifies and confronts student misconceptions. Today we look at one example of such teaching approach. Additional reading provides another, and a list of many more can be obtained from the instructors.In preparation for your first discussion group meetings, we will discuss the key underlying ideas in introductory biochemistry. We will focus on how the ideas relate to each other and where the "hooks" are that will later connect biochemistry to the other units taught in intro bio. Discussion groups start this week.

Multiple Intelligences  
  
Key Concepts in Genetics
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In 1983 Howard Gardner formulated his theory of Multiple Intelligences. Since then, many books and articles have been written on the subject of MI itself, and, more recently, on how it applies to the educational endeavor. Our discussion will focus on how to apply the principles of MI in the college environment, where large lecture-based courses are the norm.

Concept Mapping  
  
Key Concepts in Molecular Biology
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Concept mapping is a technique that asks individual learners to plot the concepts and facts together with their interrelationships in an organizational network that is meaningful to each learner. Based on the assimilation theory of cognitive learning, concept maps have the potential to illuminate student misconceptions and to present a coherent picture of student's knowledge base. We will discuss pluses and minuses of using concept maps in the context of a large lecture course or a smaller course.

Predictors of Success in College Science  
  
Key Concepts in Gene Regulation
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
One of the most frustrating aspects of teaching is watching students who by all rights should succeed in your class fail miserably. What factors predicts student success in college level science? And what can be done to improve the chances of the students who do not come from the backgrounds likely to produce success in college science? Today's paper is focused on college level physics, but some conclusions likely transfer across the spectrum of college science.

Cooperative/Group Learning  
  
Key Concepts in Recombinant DNA
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
One of the buzz words in education today cooperative or group learning. Many flavors of this type of learning exist, most with an emphasis on creating an environment where students accomplish more in a group format than any individual can accomplish by his- or herself. Some models, like the guild model discussed in today' paper, explicitly encourage the group to capitalize on each individual member's strengths to accomplish the overall goal. We will discuss applicability of various forms of group work to a number of educational environments. We will also discuss the balance between covering content and developing skills students need to acquire content on their own.

Discussion  
  
Key Concepts in Genomics
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
This week we take a break from the papers and talk to one of the best educators in the biology department - Dr. Michele Mischke. Now that you have had some experience teaching and have had a chance to read some of the literature on teaching, this freestyle discussion will give you a chance to sound out your ideas and concerns.

Case Studies  
  
Key Concepts in Nervous System
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Case method is a method of instruction that focuses on using real-world or made-up cases (case studies) as the main vehicle for learning. The goal is for students to learn through practice. Ideally, the cases are complex and even controversial, such that the students are engaged and motivated to explore the subject. We will discuss the use of cases as a tool, as well as the difference between pure case method and sporadic use of cases in the curriculum.

Gender and Science  
  
Key Concepts in Nervous System
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
We have all heard the statistics' women leave science and technology fields in droves at several key points in their education and career. Many of the proposed remedies target administrative decisions. Today we will focus on what we as educators can do to foster classroom environments that are likely to encourage retention.

Teaching Lab Courses  
  
Key Concepts in Cancer
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Lab courses are different from the lecture-based courses in that they by their nature encourage acquisition and application of skills. But the two types of courses are also similar in that ideal outcome of both is deep conceptual understanding. We will discuss the differences in the types of preparation that are needed for cook-book and student-driven active learning labs, as well as the different outcomes that can be expected from each.

Student Self-assessment  
  
Key Concepts in Immunology and AIDS
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In addition to subject-matter assessment, it is often important to understand how the course affects students' self-perception. Did the student gain confidence in their ability to approach the subject matter or another related field? Are they more likely to pay attention when the subject matter of the course shows up in the media? Are they interested in applying what they learned in their everyday lives? SALG is an instrument that was developed to assess just such questions. We will discuss the instrument itself, as well as the benefits and limitations of using self-assessment.

Teaching Evolution  
  
Key Concepts in Molecular Evolution and Stem Cells
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
Evolution is one of the fundamental subjects of modern science. It is supported by evidence from a diverse set of disciplines. And yet, somehow, the teaching of evolution in the United States remains controversial. We will discuss what it means to teach evolution to the students who graduate from American high schools.
