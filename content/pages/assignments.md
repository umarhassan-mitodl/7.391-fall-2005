Written Assignments
-------------------

You will be asked to keep a list of discussion questions you prepared for and used in the discussion sessions with some notes on how well each question worked. We will also ask you to keep a list of any misconceptions you uncover in the discussion sessions. These are not formal papers, but notes from which you can ask questions and draw conclusions. We ask that you keep the notes with a minimal degree of organization, such that they can be shared with the instructors and the rest of the class.

Oral Presentations
------------------

1.  Several times through the semester, you will be asked to give a short formal introduction to the paper discussed in class that day. Your introduction should include what you think the main point of the paper was, what you thought was particularly interesting about the paper, and any part or idea in the paper that deserves scrutiny, if any. These should be low-stress assignments.
2.  As we proceed through the semester, you will be required to be principally in charge of running the concept discussion in the second hour of the seminar.
